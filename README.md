# Password Strength Tester

A Python script to evaluate the strength of your passwords, created by [alirezabytes](https://github.com/alirezabytes).

## Overview
This script checks your password for:
- Length (minimum 8 characters recommended)
- Presence of uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Presence of lowercase letters (a-z)
- Presence of numbers (0-9)
- Presence of special characters (e.g., !@#$%)

It gives your password a score out of 100 and estimates how long it might take to crack it using brute force methods. The script uses the `wx` library to provide a simple graphical user interface (GUI).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `wxPython` library

You can install `wxPython` using pip:
```bash
pip install wxPython
```
